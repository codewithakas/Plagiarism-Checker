Plagiarism-checker-Python

Plagiarism detection on textual data involves a relatively straightforward process. 

Here's an alternative rephrasing of the explanation:
Plagiarism detection on textual data is a relatively straightforward task. Since computers excel at processing numerical data, we convert the raw text into vectors, which are numerical arrays. By leveraging basic vector operations, we can compute the similarity between two text documents.
This repository provides a simple example demonstrating how to perform such similarity calculations.
